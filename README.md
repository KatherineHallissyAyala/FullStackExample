# FullStackExample
My first full stack app, using node.js, express, and a redis database.  Written for a full-stack developer course.

# How to Use
In command line interface, browse to the folder where the files are stored.  Run "npm install" to install the dependences (express and redis).  Then run "node index.js".  In a browser, browse to "localhost:3000".  You should see an interface with a header, footer, sidebars, and center area for an article etc.  Each of these sections has a plus or minus sign.  When you click on a plus sign, you should see the corresponding number increase in all of the other sections.
